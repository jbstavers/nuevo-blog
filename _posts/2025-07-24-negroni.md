Ingredients:
- 1 part gin
- 1 part Campari
- 1 part sweet vermouth 

Instructions:
- Mix in a rocks glass with a large ice cube.
- Garnish with an orange twist.

Notes:
- If you're using good vermouth, ease up on it a bit. If you aren't, I don't want to know you. 
- 1 is fun, 2 is a lot, 3... don't drink 3.
- I once had my birthday party at a bar that served Negronis on tap. I ended the night challenging everyone around the table to a fight and telling them why I would beat them. 
- Negroni: the emperor of cocktails. I'll fight anyone who says different.
